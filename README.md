A Process Scheduler schedules different processes to be assigned to the CPU based on particular scheduling algorithms. There are six popular process scheduling algorithms which we are going to discuss in this chapter


**Project: Scheduling Algorithms**

- **Description:**
  - Developed a collection of scheduling algorithms to optimize resource allocation in operating systems.
  
- **Tools Used:** C++, Visual Studio
  
- **Implemented Algorithms:**
  1. **First Come First Serve (FCFS):**
     - Utilized Arrival Time
     - Displayed process timeline
     - Calculated average waiting and turnaround time
     
  2. **Round Robin:**
     - Utilized Time Quantum
     - Implemented time slicing
     - Calculated average waiting and turnaround time
  
  3. **Shortest Job First (SJF) - Non-preemptive:**
     - Considered burst time for scheduling
     - Demonstrated process timeline
     - Calculated average waiting and turnaround time
     
  4. **Shortest Job First (SJF) - Preemptive:**
     - Implemented preemptive scheduling
     - Displayed process timeline
     - Calculated average waiting and turnaround time
  
  5. **Priority Scheduling - Non-preemptive:**
     - Considered priority for job execution
     - Displayed process timeline
     - Calculated average waiting and turnaround time
  
  6. **Priority Scheduling - Preemptive:**
     - Implemented preemptive priority-based scheduling
     - Displayed process timeline
     - Calculated average waiting and turnaround time

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Developed algorithms and data structures to implement various scheduling methods.
  - Performed testing and debugging to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithms.
  - Conducted performance analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of each scheduling algorithm.
